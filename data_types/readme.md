## Data types in rust

Rust is a _statically typed_ language, which means that it
must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually
infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

### Scalar Types

A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.

| Length  | Signed  | Unsigned |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| 8-bit   | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit  | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit  | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit  | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| 128-bit | `i128`  | `u128`   |
| arch    | `isize` | `usize`  |

Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n - 1</sup>) to 2<sup>n -
1</sup> - 1 inclusive, where _n_ is the number of bits that variant uses. So an
`i8` can store numbers from -(2<sup>7</sup>) to 2<sup>7</sup> - 1, which equals
-128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1,
so a `u8` can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup> - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

#### Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for _floating-point numbers_, which are
numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`,
which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64`
because on modern CPUs, it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of
more precision. All floating-point types are signed.
