## Functions

Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most
important functions in the language: the `main` function, which is the entry
point of many programs. You’ve also seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.

Rust code uses _snake case_ as the conventional style for function and variable
names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words.
Here’s a program that contains an example function definition

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}


```
